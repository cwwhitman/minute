each task must have a duration
a task can refrence other tasks as dependencies
needs to have some constraints/rules (3 meals per day)
maybe have some heuristics for what a good day looks like, then find the best one out of a couple generations
gets events from gcal
my own schedule system, exports/imports to gcal. by editing files OR web interface
fills free time with things to do
